						<h2>1 on 1 Personal Training Sessions</h2>

						<p class="8u 12u$(medium)">If you live in the greater Seattle area, I see personal training clients Sunday-Thursday. I work with clients on 8 week contracts to ensure commitment and help achieve the best results. You choose how many times a week you want to train for 8 weeks and we figure out schedule availability and get started on your goals.</p>

						<h2>Online Training</h2>

						<p class="8u 12u$(medium)">Perfect for people who are already familiar with working out but just need a solid plan to follow to help maximize their results. Gym membership or equipment in your home required.</p>

						<h3>What you get</h3>
						<ul class="8u 12u$(medium)">
							<li>A workout plan designed specifically for you, your goals and your skill level. You tell me how many days a week you want to workout on your own, and I will write you a step by step plan you can take to the gym with you or do at home if you have equipment.</li>

							<li>Customized diet program tailored to your goals/needs/activity level. This isn't a one size fits all diet that I pass out to everyone. It is customized FOR YOU.</li>

							<li>Access to my private Facebook group for my clients where we share motivation, positive support, recipes, tips and jokes (usually about me) and we keep each other accountable.</li>

							<li>My coaching and support every step of the way. I'll be there via text, email and sometimes phone call to help coach you and to help teach you throughout your program. Most of my online clients are in touch with me daily if they have questions, concerns or just need a pep talk.</li>

							<li>Accountability. You will log your food on a website that I monitor, to help keep you on track and give me as much information as possible to help you reach your goals. This is perhaps the most crucial aspect of doing online training. This is important because it gives myself and the client the info needed to get you the best possible results.</li>

							<li>Unlimited jokes from me. (My most valuable service)</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="8u 12u$(medium)">My philosophy is that your workout and nutrition routine should add to your life and fit into it, rather than consume your whole life. I will teach you how to incorporate the foods you enjoy into your diet and still get the results you want. I encourage all my clients to plan foods they enjoy into their day because it makes your diet more sustainable. My motto is "life first."</p>
